This repository contains the ARM Cortex-M0 and M4 code for SABER.

The implementation for Cortex-M0 is intended as an unoptimized reference code. It comes with a framework for testing it in the XMC2Go Infineon board.

The implementations for Cortex-M4 give a trade-off between the fastest implementation available and all the available memory optimizations with a low performance penalty.
